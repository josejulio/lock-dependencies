# lock-dependencies
Lock your package.json dependencies and helps to upgrade them on demand.

If you manually update your dependencies and lock them (i.e. you don't use semver tilde `~` or caret `^`) then this package is for you.

This command line utility will take care of locking and updating on-demand, by default it locks all your dependencies 
(also devDependencies and peerDependencies) to the version specified in the package.json.

## Usage

You can use directly from `npx`, install it globally or as a `devDependency`. The examples show here are with `npx` for
convenience.

This won't modify any lock file. It will only update the `package.json` and you are left to use your
favorite tool or make any other changes.

You can check the help of it by running with `--help`

```
npx dependencies --help
Utility to help lock and upgrade dependencies of package.json file. Not meant to be automated but to help on the process.

Options:
  -p, --package-json <package-json-path>           Path to package.json file (default: "package.json")
  -u, --upgrade-strategy <lock|patch|minor|major>  Defines how to upgrade the packages: 
  - lock: Only lock to current version
  - patch: Upgrades to latest patch version
  - minor: Upgrades to latest minor version
  - major: Upgrades to latest major version
   (default: "LOCK")
  -i, --ignore-locked-dependencies                 Ignore the dependencies that are already locked (default: false)
  -h, --help                                       display help for command
```

## Examples

Each example will show the result of the command executed on the following `package.json`:
```package.json
{
  "name": "foobar",
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.2.0",
    "lodash": "4.14.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotenv": "~8.2.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "15.3.2"
  }
}
```



### Locks dependencies on current dir

`npx lock-dependencies`

```package.json

  "name": "foobar",
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "7.2.0",
    "lodash": "4.14.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotenv": "8.2.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "15.3.2"
  }
}
```


### Upgrade and lock dependencies to latest major version on current dir

`npx lock-dependencies --upgrade-strategy major`

```package.json
{
  "name": "foobar",
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "7.11.2",
    "lodash": "4.17.20"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotenv": "8.2.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "16.13.1"
  }
}
```

### Upgrade and lock dependencies to latest minor version on ./packages/foo-bar/package.json

`npx lock-dependencies --package-json ./packages/foo-bar/package.json --upgrade-strategy minor`

```package.json
{
  "name": "foobar",
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "7.11.2",
    "lodash": "4.17.20"

  }
}
```

### Upgrade and lock dependencies to latest minor, but do not touch packages already locked

`npx lock-dependencies --upgrade-strategy minor --ignore-locked-dependencies`

```package.json
{
  "name": "foobar",
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "7.11.2",
    "lodash": "4.14.2"
